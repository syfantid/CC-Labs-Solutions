# Lab 1- Guess Number Game
This project aims to generate random number for user to guess and the program is called **'Randomee'**. First by using random library in python, program generates a number
that is unknown to user. Then user is given 5 tries to guess correctly what that number is. If the user guess the wrong number the program
will guide the user to right answer by saying either "Sorry, number is too high. Try again!" or "Sorry, number is too low. Try again!"
If the user guesses the number correctly then an indication saying "Excellent guess" will appear, also the user will know in which try
he/she guessed the answer right.

Program checkes if the user typed only number otherwise (e.g. a letter) it warns user to type in correct form and continues the game again. In the end,
it gives right to play the game again to user.
