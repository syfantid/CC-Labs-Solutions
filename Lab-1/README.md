# Lab 1- Guess Number Game
This project aims to generate a random number for the user to guess and is called **'Randomee'**. First, by using the random library in python, the program generates a number that is unknown to user. Then, user is given 5 tries to guess correctly what that number is. If the user guesses the wrong number, the program will guide the user to the right answer by saying either "Sorry, number is too high. Try again!" or "Sorry, number is too low. Try again!". If the user guesses the number correctly then an indication saying "Excellent guess" will appear, also the user will know in which try he/she guessed the answer right.

The program checks if the user typed a number otherwise (e.g. a letter) it encourages the user to type a number and proceeds with the game. In the end, it allows the user to play again.
